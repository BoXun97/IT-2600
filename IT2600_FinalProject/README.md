 - You can do lots of things with a computer but, connect it up to other computers and peripherals (the general name given to add-on bits of computer equipment such as modems, inkjet and laser printers, and scanners) and you can do an awful lot more. A computer network is simply a collection of computer equipment that's connected with wires, optical fibers, or wireless links so the various separate devices (known as nodes) can "talk" to one another and swap data (computerized information).
 
 ##### *Number System*
 ```sh
 Numbers are symbols that we use to represent quantities. Binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal are four number systems used frequently in computing and networking. A numeral system (or system of numeration) is a writing system for expressing numbers; that is, a mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set, using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner. The same sequence of symbols may represent different numbers in different numeral systems.

 ##### *Types of Network*                                                                           
```sh
 Not all computer networks are the same. This part will explain the structures and functions of some computer networks. Different types of private networks are distinguished based on their sizes (in terms of the number of machines), their data transfer speeds, and their reach.

 ##### *Network Security*                                                                           
```sh
 Network security consists of provisions and policies adopted by the network administrator to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of the computer network and its network-accessible resources.[37] Network security is the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users are assigned an ID and password that allows them access to information and programs within their authority. Network security is used on a variety of computer networks, both public and private, to secure daily transactions and communications among businesses, government agencies and individuals.

 ##### *IP Address*                                                                           
```sh
An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two principal functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.
