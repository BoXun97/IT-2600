 - You can do lots of things with a computer but, connect it up to other computers and peripherals (the general name given to add-on bits of computer equipment such as modems, inkjet and laser printers, and scanners) and you can do an awful lot more. A computer network is simply a collection of computer equipment that's connected with wires, optical fibers, or wireless links so the various separate devices (known as nodes) can "talk" to one another and swap data (computerized information).
 
 ##### *Number system*
 ```sh
 Numbers are symbols that we use to represent quantities. Binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal are four number systems used frequently in computing and networking. A numeral system (or system of numeration) is a writing system for expressing numbers; that is, a mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set, using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner. The same sequence of symbols may represent different numbers in different numeral systems.

 Not all computer networks are the same. This part will explain the structures and functions of some computer networks. Different types of private networks are distinguished based on their sizes (in terms of the number of machines), their data transfer speeds, and their reach.
