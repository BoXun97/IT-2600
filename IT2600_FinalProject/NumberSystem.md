# **Number System**
 - A numeral system (or system of numeration) is a writing system for expressing numbers; that is, a mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set, using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner. The same sequence of symbols may represent different numbers in different numeral systems. For example, "11" represents the number three in the binary numeral system (used in computers) and the number eleven in the decimal numeral system (used in common life).

### Binary Number System

Characteristics of the binary number system are as follows:

1. Uses two digits, 0 and 1

2. Also called as base 2 number system

3. Each position in a binary number represents a 0 power of the base (2). Example 2⁰

4. Last position in a binary number represents a x power of the base (2). Example 2ˣ where x represents the last position -1.

### Octal Number System

Characteristics of the binary number system are as follows：

1. Uses eight digits, 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7

2. Also called as base 8 number system

3. Each position in an octal number represents a 0 power of the base (8). Example 8⁰

4. Last position in an octal number represents a x power of the base (8). Example 8ˣ where x represents the last position -1

### Hexadecimal Number System

Characteristics of hexadecimal number system are as follows：

1. Uses 10 digits and 6 letters, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F

2. Letters represent the numbers starting from 10. A = 10. B = 11, C = 12, D = 13, E = 14, F = 15

3. Also called as base 16 number system

4. Each position in a hexadecimal number represents a 0 power of the base (16). Example, 16⁰ 

5. Last position in a hexadecimal number represents a x power of the base (16). Example 16ˣ where x represents the last position -1
