# **IP Address**
- Every machine on a network has a unique identifier. Just as you would address a letter to send in the mail, computers use the unique identifier to send data to specific computers on a network. Most networks today, including all computers on the Internet, use the TCP/IP protocol as the standard for how to communicate on the network. In the TCP/IP protocol, the unique identifier for a computer is called its IP address.

*There are two standards for IP addresses: IP Version 4 (IPv4) and IP Version 6 (IPv6).*

### IPv4
> IPv4 uses 32 binary bits to create a single unique address on the network. An IPv4 address is expressed by four numbers separated by dots. Each number is the decimal (base-10) representation for an eight-digit binary (base-2) number, also called an octet. For example: 216.27.61.137

### IPv6
> IPv6 uses 128 binary bits to create a single unique address on the network. An IPv6 address is expressed by eight groups of hexadecimal (base-16) numbers separated by colons, as in 2001:cdba:0000:0000:0000:0000:3257:9652. Groups of numbers that contain all zeros are often omitted to save space, leaving a colon separator to mark the gap (as in 2001:cdba::3257:9652).

**You can’t go online without a public IP address**

>  use the internet, all connected devices must have a public IP address. An IP address allows two devices—the sender and recipient of internet communications—to find and exchange information with each other.

> The setup is similar to real-life address systems. For example, if you were to subscribe to a magazine, the magazine distributor (the sender) would need your address to send you (the recipient) your copies. Without your address, the distributors wouldn’t know where to send the magazine.

> The same applies to the internet. Without an IP address, two devices would not be able to find and exchange information with each other.
