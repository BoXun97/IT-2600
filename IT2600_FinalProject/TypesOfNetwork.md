# **Types of Network**

- Used for everything from accessing the internet or printing a document to downloading an attachment from an email, networks are the backbone of business today. They can refer to a small handful of devices within a single room to millions of devices spread across the entire globe, and can be defined based on purpose and/or size.
---
**Some of the different networks based on size are:**
> Personal area network, or PAN
> Local area network, or LAN
> Metropolian area network, or MAN
> Wide area network, or WAN

**Some of the different networks based on their main purpose are:**
> Storage area network, or SAN
> Enterprise private network, or EPN

### Different Types of Network Models

- **Reference model**
    > describes the functions that must be completed at a particular layer, but does not specify exactly how a function should be accomplished. Not intended to provide detail to define how each protocol should work at each layer. The primary purpose of is to aid in clearer understanding of the functions and processes necessary for network communications. 

- **Protocol model**
    > closely matches the structure of a particular protocol suite. A protocol suite includes the set of related protocols that typically provide all the functionality required for people to communicate with the data network. The TCP/IP model is a protocol model, because it describes the functions that occur at each layer of protocols within the TCP/IP suite.
